    "During this project, we want to be able to artificially generate a visual representation of sound-to-color synesthesia, a condition in which an individual sees colors in response to hearing specific noises. By translating frequencies into colors, we wish to create a program that can generate colors based on an inputted song. We can do this by training on a data set with .wav signals from a simple piano performance that are paired with color."
