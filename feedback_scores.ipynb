       "33  Really a standout presentation. They covered every base with incredibly visually appealing slides and took the audience slow through a course of their analysis and really explained it well, from the data cleaning to their graphs and machine leanring techniques. Their ending analysis and limitations regarding racial biases (towards end, maybe 5:12?) was fantastic and acknowlegded potential flaws.   \n",
